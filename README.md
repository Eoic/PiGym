# PiGym
## Features
1. **Practice mode** - a user can practice with configurable practice sessions: change number of digits to guess, duration (endless or timed), starting digit.
2. **Challenge mode** - a user can practice in configurable practice sessions: number of hints, starting digit, number of digits to guess, time per digit, time mode (endless or timed), mistakes allowed, etc.
3. **Statistics** - shows statistics of practices and challenges completed.
4. **Scores** - shows progression over time and a heatmap of Pi digits guessed in challenge mode (e.g., percentage guessed correctly / incorrectly).
5. **Offline first** - the app does not require authentication and can run offline.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```
