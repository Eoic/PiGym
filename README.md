# PiGym
## Features
1. Practice mode - a user can practice with configurable practice sessions: change number of digits to guess, duration (endless or timed), starting digit.
2. Challenge mode - a user can practice in configurable practice sessions: number of hints, starting digit, number of digits to guess, time per digit, time mode (endless or timed), mistakes allowed, etc.
3. Statistics page shows statistics of practices and challenges completed.
4. Scores page shows progression over time and a heatmap (red to green) of Pi digits correctly guessed in challenge mode (how many times guessed correctly and incorrectly in percent), etc.
5. The app is offline first, and does not require authentication.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```
